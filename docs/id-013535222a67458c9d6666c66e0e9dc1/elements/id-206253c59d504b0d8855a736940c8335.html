The administration layer vertically spans the data and infrastructure layer. It provides services that are required 
for the well-functioning of those layers, as well as the SMP as a whole. These services regard security, 
identification and access control, monitoring, and more. The administration layer enables data spaces to federate 
the different actors and allows actors to operate their components in the data space.

The administration layer addresses the main capabilities that will assure the correct delivery of capabilities within Simpl-Open. Despite being depicted as isolated bubbles, capabilities and building blocks are strongly related and further discussed (see Annex 6). The function of this layer can be described as a set of supervision and management functions that will lead to a better control and interoperability of the rest of Simpl-Open building blocks. Along with the later described governance layer, it will play an executive role within Simpl-Open.

Whenever a consumer accesses a resource through Simpl-Open, the Contracts capability will determine if the licenses are correctly delivered. It will also register the billing terms and will manage the service level agreements as specified by the providers, as well as managing the permissions related to data sharing. The usage contracts will be accessible through this Administration layer every time a consumer requests a data or computing resource.

The Logging, Monitoring and Reporting  capabilities are strongly interconnected. In the case of Logging, it is regarded as the real time information collection, while Monitoring is about screening the collected information and registering alerts and usage information concerning other layer&#180;s building blocks, as well as energy and quality of service optimization. On the other hand, the Reporting capability will handle the historical record of such information, as well as the general platform usage, allowing the relevant stakeholders to export and log the extraction of the information obtained. These two capabilities could be visualised as a supervision of the processes taking part at every layer level within Simpl-Open. Should additional action be taken, the Governance Authority will resolve the situation with the assistance of other Administration layer blocks such as Security or Contracts.

In order to analyse if the resources given by Simpl-Open are meeting contracts, access or security requirements, an auditing tool in the Audit capability will be capable of receiving information inputs from the logging, reporting and monitoring building blocks. By comparing what is expected from Simpl-Open resources and what is actually happening at a resource delivery level, the audit capability will interact with the Logging, Reporting and Monitoring capabilities.

The Administration layer will perform consistent and continuous analysis of the usage with the help of the Reporting and Monitoring capabilities. Along with the Auditing capability, the Administration capabilities will extract valuable information about the resources exchanged between the consumer and the data, application, and infrastructure provider(s). This will include analysis of the usage kept in metrics logging and real-time monitoring, which will be transferred to the reporting capability for a wider history data recording. In this reporting function, performance of deployed resources, the level of efficiency or the usage of the platform and the sustainable utilization will be supervised by the administration.</div>
