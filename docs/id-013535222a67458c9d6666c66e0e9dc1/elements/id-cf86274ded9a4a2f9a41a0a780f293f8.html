Crucially, the Integration layer acts as an entry door towards the other layers. Below sections describe how the Data and Infrastructure layer are organised. The data layer provides blocks related to applications and data, whereas the infrastructure layer provisions computing, storage, and other infrastructure resources. When a consumer needs to access any of the building block belonging to the Data layer, the Access control &amp; Trust capability is triggered to assure the right permissions are given. Additionally, authentication and authorization mechanisms are a prerequisite for executing the Data layer building blocks, such as the Application or Data sharing capabilities.

Once the Integration layer confirms the identity and the role of the end user, the contract capability of the administration layer is activated in order to verify the terms agreed and the Service Level Agreements. After this process, data building blocks can be executed. The explanation above concerning data building blocks is applicable to the Infrastructure layer building blocks in case the consumer is intending to access computing, storage, or other infrastructure resources. Nevertheless, it will be common to combine data and infrastructure resource usage by means of a distributed execution. It must be noted that beyond the usage of data and infrastructure resources in combination, independent use of infrastructure or data alone will be a possibility as well.

When considering the security and orchestration needs for the global usage of any of the Data and Infrastructure layers building blocks, the Integration Security and Federation management will be responsible of the correct encryption and verification deployments, assuring as well a correct allocation and interoperability of the resources. It must be noted however that both the Data and the Infrastructure layers will hold their own local orchestration blocks as explained in their respective sections.</div>
